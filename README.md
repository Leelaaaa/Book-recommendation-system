# Book-recommendation-system
OVERVIEW 
Welcome to my project "Book Recommender System." This project is about building a system that suggests books to users based on what they like and their reading habits. Using machine learning and book data, the goal is to create a personalized way to recommend books.

Table of Contents
Introduction
There are many books out there, and readers often want suggestions that fit their interests. This project aims to build a system that looks at what users like, their past reading, and book details to give them book recommendations made just for them.

Dataset
The data includes information about books, users, and how users interact with books. It has details like book titles, genres, user ratings, and which books users have read or rated. This data helps build the recommendation system.

Project Goals
The main goals of this project are:

Prepare and clean the data for building the recommendation system.

Try out and compare different algorithms to suggest books.

Create an easy-to-use interface where users can get book recommendations.

Make the recommendation experience interactive and personalized.

Methods Used
Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data by fixing missing info and converting categories into usable formats. Split data into training and testing sets to build and check the model.

Recommendation Algorithms:
Use different methods like Popularity-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering (user-user and item-item) to suggest books based on user behavior and book details.

Evaluation:
Measure how well the algorithms work using accuracy, precision, recall, and user satisfaction. Check if the system gives good, relevant recommendations.

Results:
Show how well each algorithm performs and allow users to try the system to get real-time book suggestions.
